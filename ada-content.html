            Ada’s mother, Annabella Byron, was the straight-laced counterpoint to her father,
             Lord Byron, the Romantic poet, who called his wife the “Princess of Parallelograms.”
              A month after Ada’s birth, Annabella Byron moved their daughter out of their London house, 
              and away from Lord Byron’s influence.

            Augusta Ada Lovelace is known as the first computer programmer, and, since 2009,
             she has been recognized annually on October 15th to highlight the often overlooked contributions of women to math and science.
             When Babbage began devising a new project, 
             the “Analytical Engine”—sketched out as a hulking machine with thousands of cogwheels that could perform more functions with
              greater accuracy—Lovelace served as its key interpreter.Lovelace became interested in Babbage’s machines as early as 
              1833 when she was introduced to Babbage by their mutual friend,
              author Mary Somerville, and, most notably, in 1843 came to translate and annotate an article written by the Italian mathematician
               and engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea.
           </p>

           <p class="ALContent">
            Her translation, along with her notes, was published in 1843,
             and represent her greatest contribution to computer science:
              she described with clarity how Babbage’s device would work, 
              illuminating its foundations in the Jacquard loom. Just as Joseph-Marie Jacquard’s silk-weaving machine
               could automatically create images using a chain of punched cards, so too could Babbage’s system—the engine,
                Lovelace explained, weaved algebraic patterns.
           </p>

           <p class="ALContent">
            Furthermore, she understood how to make it do the things computers do. 
            She suggested the data input that would program the machine to calculate Bernoulli numbers, 
            which is now considered the first computer program. But more than that, Lovelace was a visionary: 
            She understood that numbers could be used to represent more than just quantities, and a machine that 
            could manipulate numbers could be made to manipulate any data represented by numbers. She predicted that machines 
            like the Analytical Engine could be used to compose music, produce graphics, and be useful to science. Of course, 
            all that came true—100 years later.

            <li>At the age of 12, Lovelace conceptualized a flying machine.</li>
            <li>At the age of 17, Lovelace met inventor and mathematician Charles 
                Babbage and watched him demonstrate a model portion of his difference engine, 
                an enormous mathematical calculating machine.</li>
            <li>Lovelace’s ideas about computing were so far ahead of their time that it took nearly a century for technology to catch up.</li>
            <li>A computer programming language is named in Lovelace’s honor.</li>
