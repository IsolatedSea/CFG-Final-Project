            You have to learn their language. I think the Internet is one of the technological wonders of the world, and 
            just to have been there at ground zero was pretty exciting stuff'

            In 1969, right as the network was beginning to grow, 
            Elizabeth “Jake” Feinler was working for SRI International (formerly Stanford Research Institute), 
            one of the first institutions included in the ARPANET. She was hired to work specifically at the Network Information Center (NIC). 
            At first her job was to create a resource handbook, something tangible to share at a conference. 
            But, her role quickly developed as her work was deemed an investment into the larger community. 
            As editor of the ARPANET Resource Handbook, Feinler became an expert on all things ARPANET. 
            She compiled and wrote documentation to help users access and use ARPANET, 
            maintained a directory of the ever-expanding network of computers, 
            and developed and documented standards for its use. 
            For a time, her team even ran a 24/7 telephone hotline to help users.

           <p class="EFContent">
            Feinler was leading the Literature Research section of SRI's library when,
             in 1972, Doug Engelbart recruited her to join his Augmentation Research Center (ARC),
             which was sponsored by the Information Processing Techniques Office of the US Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA). 
             Her first task was to write a Resource Handbook for the first demonstration of the ARPANET at 
             the International Computer Communication Conference. 
             By 1974 she was the principal investigator to help plan and run the new Network Information Center (NIC) for the ARPANET.

           <p class="EFContent">
                Feinler remained at SRI until she retired in 1989, 
                shortly before ARPANET was decommissioned. Still, 
             the global network she helped sustain and enrich for ever-broadening users is what became the backbone of our modern internet. 
                In fact, the top-level domain names that we are so familiar with now—.com, .gov, .org, .net, and .edu.

                Elizabeth was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame in 2012. 
                Since retiring, she has been a consultant at The Computer History Museum, 
                where she donated, organized, and detailed over 350 boxes of archives from the Engelbart and NIC projects.

            <li>At the turn of the 21st century, 
                Feinler was inducted into the SRI Alumni Hall of Fame.</li>
            <li>In retirement she consistetly volunteers at the Computer History Museum,
                where she co-compiled a timeline for development of e-mail.</li>
            <li><u>How Feinler got her nickname, "Jake":</u>
                "When I was born, double names were popular. 
                My real name is Elizabeth Jocelyn Feinler, 
                and my family was going to call me Betty Jo to match my sister’s name, Mary Lou. 
                Only two at the time, my sister’s version of Betty Jo sounded like Baby Jake. 
                I always say, Thank goodness they dropped the 'Baby'."</li>
